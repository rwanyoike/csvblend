> Join or merge multiple CSVs.

csvblend is a Python library to merge multiple CSVs based on a list of columns efficiently.

NOTE: csvblend requires SQLite version 3.24.0 (2018-06-04) or better:

```shell
python -c 'import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)'
```

Basic merge usage:

```python
>>> from csvblend import MergeFiles
>>> columns = ["field1", "field2", "field3"]
>>> indexes = ["field1"]
>>> with MergeFiles(columns, indexes) as mf:
...     with open("csvfile1") as fp:
...         mf.merge(fp)
...     with open("csvfile2") as fp:
...         mf.merge(fp)
...     with open("csvfile3") as fp:
...         mf.merge(fp)
...     for row in mf.rows():
...         print(row)
```
